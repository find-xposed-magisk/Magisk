## R65976974-kitsune (26404)

- [Module] Fix symlink is mistakely marked as whiteout for systemless deteting, which cause symlink fails to be added to system. This problem exists from the first day of kitsune and no one reports ðŸ˜‘, also there are not much modules that replace/add symlinks. Please update to this version to solve the symlink problem.

### Diffs to official Magisk

- [App] Added a new feature to install Magisk into `/system` partition for emulators that do not have a boot image.
- [Zygisk] Changed the method of loading Zygisk to ptrace init implementation (required Android 8+). The implementation comes from [ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext). This method does not need to change any property and is more compatible with some emulators that ignore `ro.dalvik.vm.native.bridge` property.
- [General] Enhanced the support for mounting in pre-init for modules. This enables modules to modify the system before the init process starts, which can be useful for some advanced use cases.
- [General] Implemented a new feature to support deleting file by using indicated whiteout character device, similar to `overlayfs`. This allows modules to delete files from the original system without actually modifying it.
- [Zygisk] Added support for GrepheneOS Android 14, a privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility. This is because the official Magisk does not support it.
- [General] Restored support for devices with no selinux support, which was removed by the official Magisk. This allows users to use Magisk on devices that do not have selinux enabled in kernel.
- [General] Change the mounting `su` location from `/system/bin` to `/apex/com.android.runtime/bin`. This is to reduce bind mount. For most apps (that don't change/hardcode `PATH` variable), this change should not break anything. An known app is Termux which hardcode `PATH` might fail to locate `su`, you can call `/debug_ramdisk/su`.
- [Module] Cancel the writable exception for `/system/etc/hosts`. Please write to safely place `/data/adb/modules/hosts/system/etc/hosts` (built-in hosts) instead. App like Adaway might not work.
