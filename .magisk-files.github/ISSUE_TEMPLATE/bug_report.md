## READ BEFORE OPENING ISSUES

DO NOT REPORT IF YOU HAVE ANY MODULES INSTALLED, OR DISABLE THEM FIRST!!!!

Please make sure that your problem is reproducible and happened on Kitsune Magisk only

All bug reports require you to **USE DEBUG BUILDS**. Please include the version name and version code in the bug report.

If there is problem with Magisk itself, please attach Magisk logs from /cache/magisk.log and /cache/magisk.log.bak

If you experience a bootloop, attach a `dmesg` (kernel logs) when the device refuse to boot. This may very likely require a custom kernel on some devices as `last_kmsg` or `pstore ramoops` are usually not enabled by default. In addition, please also upload the result of `cat /proc/mounts` when your device is working correctly **WITHOUT MAGISK**.

Without following the rules above, your issue will be closed without explanation.
